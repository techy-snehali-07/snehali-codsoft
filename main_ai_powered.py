🚀 “Pursue excellence, and success will follow.”
We all grew up hearing Rancho's words echo in our hearts — calm, quirky, and full of wisdom.
Like many of us, choosing engineering wasn’t just a career move, it was a passion. And Rancho made us believe in that dream. 💡💻

So for my CodSoft Internship, I built something close to my heart:
🎓 Rancho Chatbot — a fun, interactive Python bot that talks like Rancho, thinks like Rancho, and maybe even gives you life advice like Rancho.

🧠 It’s not powered by fancy AI models (yet), but runs on logic, creativity, and a love for coding — just the way Rancho would've liked.

✨ Features:
🎤 A dark-themed GUI inspired by Rancho’s calm personality
🗨️ Rule-based replies that feel like you’re chatting with your favorite 3 Idiots character
📚 Covers everything from stress and love to machines and marks — all with Rancho’s classic style
👩‍💻 Made entirely with Python + Tkinter

This was more than a project — it was a reminder of why I started coding in the first place.
Can’t wait to keep building and maybe even upgrade this with real AI soon!
